## Build Instructions

This project uses [Markmap](https://markmap.js.org/) to convert Markdown files into mind maps.

To build the mind maps, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the build script:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

This will generate the HTML files in the `public/` directory.
